# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: For all project guidance, development instructions, and technical specifications, please refer to the main project documentation file:

ðŸ“– **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)**

This file contains the comprehensive and up-to-date instructions for:
- Project overview and architecture
- Development workflow and commands
- Technical implementation details
- Code organization and best practices
- Testing and deployment procedures
- Feature specifications and requirements

**Always consult CLAUDE.md first** - it is the single source of truth for this project's development guidance and is actively maintained with the latest information.

This approach ensures consistency and eliminates the need to maintain duplicate instruction sets across multiple files.
