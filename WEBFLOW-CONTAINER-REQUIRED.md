# 🔥 URGENT: Missing 3D Container in Webflow

## ✅ Good News: Scripts Are Working!
Your Webflow integration is **working perfectly**! The console shows:
- ✅ Scripts loading from localhost:8080
- ✅ Three.js loaded successfully  
- ✅ Simple 3D scene initialized successfully

## ❌ Issue: Missing HTML Container
The 3D map needs a container element to render into. Currently missing from your Webflow page:

```html
<div id="webgl-container"></div>
```

## 🛠️ Quick Fix - Add Container to Webflow

### Option 1: Add HTML Embed Element (Recommended)
1. Go to your Webflow Designer
2. Navigate to your homepage
3. Add an **HTML Embed** element where you want the 3D map
4. Paste this HTML:

```html
<div id="webgl-container" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; background: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid #ccc; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
  <div style="text-align: center; color: #666;">
    <div>🚀 3D Map Loading...</div>
    <div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 5px;">Powered by Three.js</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Option 2: Add DIV Element + Custom Attributes
1. Add a regular **DIV** element to your page
2. Select the DIV element
3. In the Element Settings panel (right side)
4. Add Custom Attribute: `id` = `webgl-container`
5. Set the DIV height to at least 400px

## 🎯 Test Results
Once you add the container, your 3D map should appear immediately because:
- ✅ Scripts are already loading correctly
- ✅ Three.js is already working
- ✅ 3D scene initialization is successful
- 🔄 Only missing the HTML element to render into

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Add the container using Option 1 above
2. Publish your site
3. Refresh the page - the 3D map should appear!
4. If you want the actual 3D model instead of the simple demo, we can upgrade to the full version

Your integration is 95% complete - just needs the container element! 🎉
